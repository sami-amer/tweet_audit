Make a Object-Oriented method to get tweets per user
- each object will be attached to a specific user
- will have thousands of objects, will need some container object for subsets?
For tweet grabbing:
- need some way to make sure we dont miss any tweets without abusing API limits
- once we have proof of concept, we can request acadmeic access
- how expensive to run this on a server (probably not a lot, it needs very little computational power, just uptime and storage). Where can we secure funding? Will blockhain version need this as well?

Do we want a stream or our own stream? How good is the twitter stream?
Can we attribute tweets to an account from stream?
