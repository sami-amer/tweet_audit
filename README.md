# Tweet Auditor

Useability roadmap:
- [x] ~add a template .server file~
- [x] ~update Rust code to accept env variables for Postgres~
- [x] ~make a python script that reads .server file and makes it into env variables~
- [x] ~make a script that reads from a per-line .txt to update or remove users~
- [x] ~group together postgres functions (i.e. adding/deleting users should update tables automatically)~
- [ ] make Toolkit and handler available on the command line
- [ ] create a sync_users that modifies local tables
- [ ] make a function that will clean up local id_name_mapping
- [ ] make a proper readme :)
